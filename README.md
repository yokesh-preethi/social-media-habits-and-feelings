# social-media-habits-and-feelings
This project analyzes social media usage across demographics. Most users are young (18â€“25) students who mainly use Facebook, which shows both positive and negative impacts. Negative feedback is common regardless of usage time, and WhatsApp is the top communication tool among those reporting worsened experiences.
